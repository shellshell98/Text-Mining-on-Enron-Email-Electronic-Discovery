"Enron was a US energy company from Houston, TX that produced and distributed power. It was very successful – its market capitalization exceeded $60 billion and was even named by Forbes as “Most Innovative US Company” from 1996 to 2001. Unfortunately, Enron engaged in widespread accounting fraud, which was discovered in October 2001. As a result, Enron’s shareholders ﬁled a $40 billion lawsuit and in December 2001, Enron ﬁled for bankruptcy, the largest in US history at the time.

Between 2000 and 2001, in the lead-up to Enron’s collapse, California was plagued by numerous blackouts, despite having plenty of power plants. It turned out that Enron played a key role in causing them, by reducing supply to the state to cause price spikes and trading energy to proﬁt from the market instability. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) investigated Enron’s involvement, eventually leading to a $1.5 billion settlement.

As part of the lawsuit, FERC obtained millions of emails from Enron. The procurement of such evidence in pre-trial proceedings is called discovery; when such evidence is in electronic form, it is called electronic discovery (or eDiscovery). The major challenge in using this evidence is determining which emails are responsive, i.e., pertinent to the lawsuit, and which are not. This leads to the question: can machine learning methods combined with text analytics be used to automate the determination of responsive emails?

In this problem, we will use a subset of the emails obtained by FERC from Enron to investigate this, contained in the ﬁle energy bids.csv. The column labeled email contains the raw text of the email, while responsive is a 0/1 column that indicates whether the email is responsive (obtained by manual labeling of the emails)."
